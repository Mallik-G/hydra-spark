hydra-spark provides a declarative and intuitive interface for creating and submitting [Apache Spark] (http://spark-project.org) 
data flow pipelines leveraging the flexibility of Spark's DataFrame API.

This repo contains the complete Hydra Spark project, including unit tests and deploy scripts.

## Features

- *"Declarative Spark Jobs"*: Simple JSON/HOCON based syntax to describe Spark jobs
- Support for Hadoop, Hive, Kafka (both as a source and sink), Elastic Search and many others. See [Sources](doc/sources.md).
- Support for both batch and Streaming jobs using a unified API. 
- Supports different Spark deploy modes (local, yarn-client) which can also be overriden at the DSL level.
- Supports Scala 2.10 and 2.11

## Version Information

| Version     | Spark Version |
|-------------|---------------|
| master      | 2.2           |

For release notes, look in the `notes/` directory.  They should also be up on [notes.implicit.ly](http://notes.implicit.ly/search/spark-jobserver).

We host non-release jars at [Jitpack](https://jitpack.io).

## Getting Started with Hydra Spark

The easiest way to get started is to try the [Docker container](doc/docker.md) which prepackages a Spark distribution with the Hydra Spark DSL assembly included.

Other ways to run:

* Build and run directly from an IDE. IntelliJ instructions follow below. 
* Run using sbt
* Run sbt assembly and copy the jar to the Spark cluster.

## Development mode

The steps below show you how to use hydra-spark with an example DSL, by running Spark in-process.  *This is not an example of usage in production.*

You need to have [SBT](http://www.scala-sbt.org/release/docs/Getting-Started/Setup.html) installed.

### Using an IDE
If you are using a Scala IDE (such as IntelliJ), you can import the project and start by running any of the test specs.  To run a specific DSL <<more docs coming>>
